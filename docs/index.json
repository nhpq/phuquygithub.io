VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) A logically isolated virtual network in AWS Allows creation of subnets to segment and control access Manages traffic routing via Route Tables 2. Internet Gateway Provides internet connectivity for the VPC Attached to public subnets so that ALB or EC2 can be accessed from the outside 3. Public Subnet Hosts the Application Load Balancer (ALB) Has routes to the Internet Gateway Entry point for traffic from the Internet 4. Private Subnet Hosts EC2 instances (backend applications) No direct route to the Internet ‚Üí increases security Can be combined with NAT Gateway if outbound traffic is needed 5. Application Load Balancer (ALB) Receives HTTP/HTTPS requests from clients Distributes traffic to EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling Group via Target Group 6. Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Manages the lifecycle of EC2 instances Automatically scales in/out based on metrics like CPU usage or number of requests Always maintains an appropriate number of EC2 instances as configured 7. EC2 Instances Servers running the web application Automatically created/terminated by ASG Can be deployed across multiple AZs for fault tolerance 8. Target Group A list of EC2 instances to which ALB distributes traffic Integrated Health Checks to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances ‚úÖ Benefits of the Architecture üü¢ Highly Available: EC2 instances available across multiple AZs for redundancy üìà Scalable: Automatically scales and optimizes cost based on traffic üîÅ Automated: No manual EC2 instance management required üîê Secure: Backend components are isolated within private subnets üìå Conclusion This architecture serves as a foundation for modern web systems on AWS.\nThe workshop will guide you step-by-step to configure, deploy, and test the model according to real-world and production standards.\n"},{"uri":"/5-alb/5.1-sg/","title":"Security Group for ALB","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Create Security Group for ALB On the EC2 page, find and select Security Groups in the left-hand menu.
